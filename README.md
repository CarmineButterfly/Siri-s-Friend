# README

## What

- This is an project about running test-davanchi-003 locally without VPN. But it's important to note that : The API which using in project is not the ChatGPT's API!

## Why

- I'm poor, VPN is too expensive for me. But I do believe that I want to use the openAI.

## How

- Please follow the `README.md` in `./client` and `./server`.

## more

- I would really appreciate it if you could launch PR for me :laughing:
